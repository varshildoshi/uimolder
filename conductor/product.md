- **Product Managers:** Needing a tool for rapid layout prototyping and iteration.

## Core Goals
- **Maximize Efficiency:** Significantly reduce development time by enabling users to create complex layouts effortlessly via Drag & Drop.
- **Comprehensive Library:** Provide an extensive collection of ready-to-use elements to eliminate repetitive coding.
- **Versatility:** Support various output formats (Flavors) and allow seamless conversion between them.
- **Scalability:** Go beyond simple forms to support complex layouts like Dashboards and Cards.

## Key Features
