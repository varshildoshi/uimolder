# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity
- **Professional & Modern Aesthetic:** The interface should be clean, high-contrast, and focused on productivity, utilizing a modern design language that resonates with developers and designers.
- **Consistent Branding:** Use the Uimolder logo and associated color palette consistently across the platform.

## User Experience (UX)
- **Intuitive Drag & Drop:** The core builder experience must be fluid and responsive, leveraging Angular CDK for a native-feeling interaction.
- **Contextual Configuration:** Property panels and configuration modals should only show relevant options for the selected element to minimize cognitive load.
- **Immediate Feedback:** Provide real-time visual updates as users modify elements or switch between flavors.

## Prose & Tone
- **Helpful & Direct:** Use clear, concise language in tooltips, labels, and documentation.
- **Technical but Accessible:** Maintain a professional tone that assumes technical competence but provides guidance where complex features are involved.

## Design Patterns
- **Modular Componentry:** Follow a strict modular approach for both the builder's UI and the components it generates.
- **Accessibility (a11y):** Ensure the platform and the exported code adhere to accessibility standards (e.g., proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation).
